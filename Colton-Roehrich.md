### Even More About Me!

I am a senior at **North Dakota State University** finishing up my degree in **Computer Science**. Three years ago I transfered here and switched my major from Earth Science Education.
Although I was sad to change my major, I still found ways to **persue Education and Programming**. I volunteer at my Church's youth group, where I help **lead highschool students**. I
also lead a college group at my church. In my free time I love hanging out with my friends! However, due to the current pandemic, we are limited to discord chats and online video 
games.
