#  planetlearning chat

## Slack

Our **Slack** chat is a great place to learn, discuss, and collaborate with other members. The chat lets our development team and interns communicate easily.

Communication is key in every collaborative project, and Planet Learning is no different. Slack provides tight integration with *Github* and provides full rich text support through **Markdown** an important tool for clean and efficient communication. Combining these features allows members to mention other members in a message, format text, share images and code, and directly link to GitHub issues and repositories.

## Best Practices

As you complete the [First Steps](vi/firststeps.md), we want you to keep us updated in the Slack chat. Generally, you should comment in the chat when you make an issue or pull request, and then link to it. Make a mention (@*name*) of someone when you comment on their issue/pull request, then link to it.

This good etiquette helps streamline communication between internship candidates and staff members alike! Feel free to look through the chat for more examples.

You may want to include clarifying *images* with your messages. To add an image in the chat, either drag and drop or copy and paste it into the messaging area.
