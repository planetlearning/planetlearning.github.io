# First Steps

# The Big Picture

Welcome to the first steps for becoming a Virtual Intern at OLE! These first steps are a process to prove that you have learned the foundational skills before you can progress to working on harder projects with larger teams. Consider this to be the interview for the internship.

If you are selected for the internship after completing the steps, you will be officially invited to join the OLE interns team! We’ll add you to the Virtual Interns Slack chatroom and assist you to a learn angular and assign team to work on developing and improving OLE's software.

# The Steps
Social coding is a huge part of any open source and collaborative project, and the Open Learning Exchange (OLE) is no different. In the following series of steps, you will learn about Markdown, Vagrant, Docker, Git, GitHub, GitHub issues, GitHub pull requests, etc. You will also be introduced to OLE’s digital library that hosts the learning materials – [Planet](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/planet).

Because these steps are simple, we expect high-quality work, which may take a longer time. We want to see that you are capable of using or learning how to use these tools (writing good GitHub issues, creating pull requests, using Markdown and Docker, etc.). These steps may seem easy, but we want you to impress us with good GitHub etiquette and quality Markdown. The bare minimum would be to just passively follow the steps; you should do further reading about the tools languages we use so you can further your understanding and relieve confusion if you're unclear about how something works. **Treat these steps as learning opportunities!** The GitHub and Markdown skills you practice here are very important for both this internship and a future software development career.

We also want you to keep us updated a relatively good amount in the [Slack chat]() as you complete these steps. We will ask you to send us messages, links, and screenshots along the First Steps, and we will use this to track your progress, so please do not forget to do so.

## Step 0 - Introductory Steps

1. Complete the [New Virtual Intern Application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScG3PB5xvWfwowgqsCI8AVwb1yrv71YZmC9lWL1O7OyT2KVOg). If you have already done this after being invited to join the team then good job, you're all set!

2. Connect to our [Slack chat channel](pages/chat.md)

### Setting up your environment

We interact with a command terminal which is natively available for both Mac and Linux based systems. If however you are on a Windows device, [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win) is highly recommended.

### Working with Vi & Vim

One of the most simple but most powerful text editors out there is Vim. If you want to see what Vim can do and how powerful it can be, you can learn more about Vim [here](https://danielmiessler.com/study/vim/#textobjects).


## Step 1 - Github

1. Log into your [GitHub account](https://github.com/) then watch [planetlearning.github.io repo](https://github.com/planetlearning/planetlearning.github.io) and Follow [Dogi](https://github.com/dogi) and [Lmmrssa](https://github.com/lmmrssa) on GitHub.

In GitHub, we "[Watch](https://help.github.com/en/articles/watching-and-unwatching-repositories)" organization repositories and ["Follow" (https://help.github.com/en/articles/following-people) individuals. Look for the "Watch" button at the top right of the page when you are in a repository.  Also, follow each other to see what others in the group are doing.

2. Using [GitHub](github.md)

## Step 2 - Markdown

Follow the instructions on [Markdown](markdown.md)

Make sure that you've linked to your github.io and pull request in the [Slack chat](). Also, include the `raw.githack` link in your pull request `https://raw.githack.com/YourUserName/YourUserName.github.io/YourBranchName/#!pages/vi/profiles/YourUserName.md`

**NOTE**: The `raw.githack` link is case sensitive to your username. 


> Once you complete Step 2 you will have:

* 1 Pull request made

Check your progress [here](trackprogress.md)

## Step 3 - Planet and Vagrant

There are 3 sub-steps in this step:


1. [Planet Installation with Vagrant](#!./pages/vi/planet-installation-vagrant.md)
  The **Planet** is a virtual library that is deployed internationally to individuals in countries that typically do not have access to educational resources. In this step, you will learn about how to set up your own Community Planet using vagrant.

2. [Planet Configurations](#!./pages/vi/configurations-vagrant.md)
  In this step, you will learn about how to configure your Community Planet.

3. [Vagrant Tutorial](#!./pages/vi/vagrant.md)
  **Vagrant** is an open-source software product for building and maintaining portable virtual software development environments. In th is step, you will learn about how to interact with Vagrant through the command-line interface.
