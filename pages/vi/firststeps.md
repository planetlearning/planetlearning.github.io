# First Steps

# The Big Picture

Welcome to the first steps for becoming a Virtual Intern at OLE! These first steps are a process to prove that you have learned the foundational skills before you can progress to working on harder projects with larger teams. Consider this to be the interview for the internship.

If you are selected for the internship after completing the steps, you will be officially invited to join the OLE interns team! We’ll add you to the Virtual Interns Slack chatroom and assist you to a learn angular and assign team to work on developing and improving OLE's software.

# The Steps
Social coding is a huge part of any open source and collaborative project, and the Open Learning Exchange (OLE) is no different. In the following series of steps, you will learn about Markdown, Vagrant, Docker, Git, GitHub, GitHub issues, GitHub pull requests, etc. You will also be introduced to OLE’s digital library that hosts the learning materials – [Planet](https://github.com/open-learning-exchange/planet).

Because these steps are simple, we expect high-quality work, which may take a longer time. We want to see that you are capable of using or learning how to use these tools (writing good GitHub issues, creating pull requests, using Markdown and Docker, etc.). These steps may seem easy, but we want you to impress us with good GitHub etiquette and quality Markdown. The bare minimum would be to just passively follow the steps; you should do further reading about the tools languages we use so you can further your understanding and relieve confusion if you're unclear about how something works. **Treat these steps as learning opportunities!** The GitHub and Markdown skills you practice here are very important for both this internship and a future software development career.

We also want you to keep us updated a relatively good amount in the [Slack chat]() as you complete these steps. We will ask you to send us messages, links, and screenshots along the First Steps, and we will use this to track your progress, so please do not forget to do so.
