About Me
---------------
I recently graduated from California State University, Long Beach with a Bachelor's Degree at Computer Science back in May 2020. 
I'm currently working as a freelance front-end developer for one company at this time. At my job, I've only used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
and I'm in the process of learning more tools to develop better websites. My strongest programming languages are Java and Python. 
In this internship, I hope to learn the programming practices and languages used in the industry while gaining experience at the same time. 
I am also a avid gamer and I love playing fighting games like Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat :video_game:.

My Sample Projects
-------------------------
The following are two of the projects I have worked on over the year
- ***RAISING SPIRITS MULTIPLAYER CARD GAME***  
  - Raising spirits is an online multiplayer co-op card game where you cooperate with other players to defeat the boss. This game was developed by me 
  and four other developers, an artist, a musician, and a writer. 
  - The game developed using Unity and C#
  - My role in the development is the UI and Front-End Developer.	I implemented functionalities such as working buttons, colliders, scriptable objects,
  & animations to make the user-interface up and running.
  - I am also responsible for implementing features relating to the user interface of the game including sounds, visuals, cards for players and bosses.
  (coolest role!)

- ***ANIFLIX***
  - Aniflix is a joke idea that I have back in Spring of 2020 where I can create my own Netflix (minus the videos) using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
  - Aniflix ended up being useful to me in the long run because it helps me keep track of the anime shows I'm interested in watching or about to watch. :satisfied:
  - I am currently maintaining this site up to this day
  - Check out Aniflix's website [here](https://aniflix.fun)

Goals
-------------------------
My current goals as of right now is to gain more experience on the field of software development so I can be a decent software developer 
when I become one. I also wanted to learn more tools such as React, Angular, and Web services like AWS so I can develop better programs
or websites.
