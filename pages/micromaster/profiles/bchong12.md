# Branden Chong, Los Angeles, Ca, windows 10/macOS Catalina
Hi! My name is **Branden** and I am currently a sophmore at *Arizona State University*. I started coding this march and attended ***DevMountain***, a coding bootcamp 
in September. 
I want to:
- learn
- make friends
- gain experience!

> I have some experience coding with the ***MERN*** stack
> - from bootcamp
> - from Udemy

It should hopefully *aid* me.

My **personal portfolio** website containing all my work can be found [here](https://brandenchong.netlify.app/).

### I look forward to working with you all!
