### My Coding Journey
I began a self-paced journey studying code/software engineering in 2018.  With no prior experience, I began by diving into [Harvard's CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science).
After this, my main resources for the past two years have been:
[Watch & Code](https://watchandcode.com/) | [Qwasar Silicon Valley](https://qwasar.io/)
------------ | -------------
Learn by **reading** code | Learn by **writing** code
Dive deep into `Javascript` | Learn multiple new languages including `C`, `Ruby On Rails`
Read Open Source Codebases | Write numerous small programs increasing in size and complexity
Work as Open Source Contributor (devtools - _Mozilla Firefox_) | Work on lots of individual and group software projects
One of my commmits to the [Firefox Debugger](https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/autoland/rev/25a282bca05b) | One of my group projects: a clone of [_Basecamp_](https://stormy-crag-63797.herokuapp.com/)

### About Me
#### Musician
After getting two degrees in music performance, I spent the first fifteen years of my career performing with orchestras around the United States. 
My instrument was the French Horn, and I held contracts with the Louisiana Philharmonic, Rochester Philharmonic, San Francisco Chamber Orchestra, and Sarasota Opera Orchestra among others.
Here's a fun post-concert photo with the horn section of the San Francisco Symphony on a tour of Europe in 2014 (I'm in front on the right):

#### Post-Musical Career
My performance career was cut short by an injury called [Musician's Focal Dystonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_dystonia).  
After working for a year as a professional beer brewer, I accepted a position as a manager for a local dog walking company,
which gives me a lot more time to code and study - plus I get to work with [dogs](https://scontent-ort2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/42494209_1961609303878135_2868037267434242048_o.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=2&_nc_sid=8bfeb9&_nc_ohc=kHJH7qOiFwEAX-rwnpV&_nc_ht=scontent-ort2-1.xx&oh=818958cbcd485314dec3897ae1c05346&oe=5FB53724)! 

#### Current Goals
- Start working full-time as a software engineer.
- Focus on software projects that will help to solve problems in our society.

I'm really excited to join you all in this community, continuing to grow and learn while contributing to the important work of _OLE_!
