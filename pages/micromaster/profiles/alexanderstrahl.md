### About me
My nick name's Zan, I really love both design and development. I graduated last year with Degrees in both Computer Science and Graphic Design.
But I was in a really bad car accedent in April. Broken: clavicle, pelvis, and jaw, amoung other things.
It's taken me a while to recover, but I'm now fully recovered and I'm looking to get back in the game.
I'm hoping that this Internship will help give me a boost to get a good job.
