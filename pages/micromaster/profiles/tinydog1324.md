### About Me

Hello my name is Tim Benedix. I am a freelance Web Developer. I am a self taught  Web Developer. I have always been intrigued by how the internet and websites,apps etc work. How they are created , how they respond and get from point a to point b. So Ive taken courses and classes learning and writing code creating projects and applications for the past 2+ years. IT would be a dream to work with Open Learning Exchange. To work on real world projects that have a positive impact. To gain that knowldge and expereience. Work along side other developers.
