>Hello World!
  
I'm Emily ðŸ”° ðŸŒ» ðŸ§© and will be finishing my degree with a concentration on Application Development next Spring. 
After majoring in English Literature, I became interested in programming when I started going through Codecademy courses.
My future goal is to become a full-stack developer. If I have the opportunity, I would like to learn Natural Language Processing.
I am bilingual and studied Japanses for 2 years, so languages naturally interest me. ðŸ˜Ž
