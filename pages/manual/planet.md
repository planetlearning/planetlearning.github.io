Since 2007, OLE International has helped establish Open Learning Communities for children, adolescents, and young adults, including those whose lives have been disrupted by violent conflicts.  Today there are OLE affiliates in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America.

# PLANET

## Introduction

### _What is the OLE Planet Learning System (Planet)?_

Personalized Learning And Networked Enabled Teams (Planet) is a multilingual learning system and library with thousands of educational resources including books, videos, and educational games. The system also includes software tools for content and student management, student evaluation and monitoring, and Courses creation.

At the core, Planet is a repository of free, open access, and public domain resources designed to benefit literate and preliterate, young and old, and novice and expert learners of all ages. Resources of all kinds (literature, health, science, math, etc.), in various languages (English, Somali, Swahili, Arabic, Spanish, etc.), and in various formats (text, audio, video) are continually being added to Planet.

The Planet system exists in the cloud but it can also be configured to run locally without the need for internet connectivity making it a viable solution for remote locations where internet connectivity is unreliable or nonexistent. Planet facilitates frequent assessments of learners, leaders, and administrators. It also promotes the evaluation and effectiveness of the learning resources. Robust usage feedback metrics make Planet a powerful tool for those overseeing monitoring and evaluation of the education system.

### _What are Planet Nations and Communities?_

Under the Planet system, there are two types of structures: **Nations** and **Communities**.

![Planet System Hierarchy Chart](images/planet-nations-tree.png)

![Planet System Flow Chart](images/planet-nations-bubbles.png)

* **Nations**
  * **Nations** always exist in the cloud and require an internet connection to access.
  * Each **Nation** serves as a central repository for the **Community** or a group of communities that it serves.
  * Different **Nations** cannot connect to each other.

* **Communities**
  * A **Community** is a local installation of the Planet system.
  * A **Community** does not require an internet to access.
  * Users can connect to a **Community** using any device having a web browser like tablet, computer, etc. The connection is established via a router through a locally configured _intranet_.
  * Each **Community** connects periodically to a **Nation** via _internet_ in order to receive new materials and to upload user metrics.
  * A **Community** is not able to connect to other **Communities**.

The **Nations** may store thousands of Resources in many formats and languages. Unique collections of Resources can be selected and downloaded into each **Community** from the **Nation**. This gives a Learner a personalized approach to his or her education.

**NOTE:** Each Planet system is unique; universal memberships do not exist. If you become a member of a specific Nation or Community, you do not automatically become a member of any other existing Nations and Community. To become a member of another Nation or Community you must register with a new account.

## Become Member
To be able to use **PLANET** you need to be part of the system. First thing you 
will see on PLANET is **Login page**.

### How to get to Become Member
When you first open Planet, you will see the login page. Click on the "Become a member" button to create your account.

![](images/planet-login.png)

To return to the login page from the "Become a member" page, click on the "Already have an account?" button.

![](images/planet-become-member.png)

### Different kind of roles available in system
There are several different roles available in Planet: "admin", "manager", "learner", "leader", and "monitor". Members are "learners" by default, and only the "admin" is allowed to set specific roles of members.

### What are the differences between Learners, Leaders, and Managers?
In the Planet system, there are three different kinds of users: Learners, Leaders, and Managers.

**Learner** is the default user level when a person first joins. Each person continues to be a Learner regardless of additional responsibilities and roles. All Learners have access to standard and individualized user functionality.

**Leaders** are Learners that have created a Course or have become Course Leaders. Leaders have access to all Learner functionality and to additional Course management functionality.

**Managers** have access to Learner, Leader, and additional functionality that allow them to manage local Resources, publications, collections, surveys, data sync schedules, and local software updates.

If you are currently using this manual, then you are most likely a manager who is organizing and overseeing a Community or a Nation and its Communities. In order to see the available manager functionality, click on “Manager” next to your name on the Dashboard (see below, *How do I navigate the Dashboard*). Managers can also add, hide, delete, and view the details of Resources as well they can create, edit, re-categorize, and delete collections.

### User profile
Click on the profile button in the top right corner of Planet. Here, you can view or edit your profile, change your password, or logout. Be sure to log out once you are finished with your session.

	In the image seen first below, the correct answer is set by checkbox to be the second choice, "Two".  
	
	* Multiple answer  
	In the image seen last below, the correct answer is set by checkbox to be the first, second, and fourth choices, "One", "Two", and "Four".

![Multiple choice single answer](images/courses-test-mc-single.png)
![Multiple choice multiple answer](images/courses-test-mc-multiple.png)

While multiple choice questions are automatically graded, text questions must be manually graded.

![Survey creation](images/courses-survey.png)

Upon clicking the "Add Question" button, you will find there are four types of questions based on two categories __Text__ and __Multiple Choice__:  


* Text - Simply fill out the question detail or query for this type of question. The survey taker will automatically get a textbox for filling out his or her answer.  
	* Short answer: Usually single line short answers.  
	* Long answer: More possibly to be very long descriptive answers.

### Course Collections

Course collections are the categories that a course can have, assisting in finding a desired course when you want to search your list of courses by category.

Collections can be standalone without being a subcollection of another collection, or can set another collection as its supercollection, as long as that supercollection is not a supercollection of another collection. In other words, there can only be one layer of collection to subcollection correlation.

There are two ways of filtering the Courses page by collection:

![Filtering](images/courses-filtering.png)

1. By clicking on the "Collections" button next to "Courses" on the top-left of the page. This will bring up a module where you can filter the course list on the Courses page by selecting checkboxes next to collections and subcollections, seeing only the courses that have these collections or subcollections. 

You are also able to edit the course's name or subcollection status from this module.

![Filtered](images/courses-filtered.png)

2. By clicking directly on the collection name listed under the course, you can filter the courses by the clicked collection. Free collections are blue while subcollections are gray.

Note that this filtering is not retroactive, and clicking on a subcollection to click on its supercollection afterwards will not update the filtering to filter by the supercollection.

### Taking a Test

In order to take a test, you must first [join](#Actions_on_List_Page) the course. If you have not joined the course, you will only see the Preview button and not the Take Test button. The visuals of both are identical, but while previewing, you will not be able to submit your answers.

One of the roles in planet is the Manager. The admin, as well as other managers, will have the ability to promote members to manager, set roles, and perform tasks such as syncing the community with the nation and upgrading the local community.

The Manager role comes with another set of administrative features, including viewing reports, syncing the community with the nation, and performing upgrades on the community.

## Community Page
Once a user successfully logs in to Planet, they will see the following screen. If you are using the community version, the left side of the panel (see red box) has four tabs __News__, __Community Leaders__, __Services__, and __Finances__ and the right side of the panel (see blue box) has a calendar view.

Here is the breakdown of what each tab does:  

* __News__: Manage stories by creating, editing, or deleting your story, or by replying to a story within the community.  
* __Community Leaders__: See the list of all admins and leaders within the community. (Users also have the option of changing the title of a member.)  
* __Services__: Displays details and information about the community. Users can edit the community description and link the associated teams or enterprises to the community.  
* __Finances__: Displays all transactions related to the community, including income and spendings.  

The calendar section is used to manage events. Click on the __"Add Event"__ button to create an event. Once the event is created and displayed on the calendar, users can edit or delete the event.
